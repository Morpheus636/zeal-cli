# Usage
Right now, Zeal_CLI only supports Linux.

# Installation

## Linux - From Binary
1. Download the linux build from the most recent [release](https://github.com/Morpheus636/zeal_cli/releases)
2. Create a directory `~/zeal-cli/`
3. Copy the linux build to that directory.
4. Give the file executable permissions (`chmod +x ~/zeal-cli/zeal-cli`)
5. Symlink it to a location on PATH (I personally use `~/.local/bin/`)

## Usage
Usage information can be found by running `zeal-cli --help`
