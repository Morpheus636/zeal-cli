# Usage
Right now, Zeal_CLI only supports Linux.

## Installation - Linux
1. Download the linux build from the most recent [release](https://github.com/Morpheus636/zeal_cli/releases)
2. Give the file executable permissions using `chmod +x /path/to/executable`
3. At this point, you can run the file explicitly with `/path/to/executable/`, but it's reccommended that you do the following:
   1. Rename the executable to just `zeal-cli`.
   2. Copy (or symlink) it to a location on PATH (I personally use `~/.local/bin/` but you can use whatever you want).
   - These steps make it so you can run the executable as just `zeal-cli`

## Usage
All usage information can be found by running the executable with the --help flag.
