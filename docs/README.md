# Zeal CLI
Zeal CLI is a command-line-interface for managing [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org/) docsets on Linux. It's syntax is roughly based on the basic syntax of the `apt` package manager, because Zeal CLI is basically a package manager for docsets.

Just like Zeal, Zeal_CLI sources docsets from [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash). Special thanks to Dash's developer, [Kapeli](https://github.com/Kapeli) for granting me permission to use their docsets.
